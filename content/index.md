## What to expect

You can expect PowerPoints and videos; of course, you'll work on the workbook. This class is interactive, and you must participate to get credit.

When the class is over, we, the school, will automatically electronically notify the Arizona Motor Vehicle Division (MVD) that you have taken and passed the class. It will take the MVD 2-3 business days to do their processing. Also, after the class, your instructor will send you a certificate of completion for your records.

## In-Person Classes

* Please be there by 7:45 am to get checked in.
* You will need your photo ID and $129 payment or proof of payment to check in.
* In-person class costs $129. You can pay via invoice, money order, or cash. It must be the exact amount if you choose to pay in cash. The instructor in the class will not be able to give you change. If you arrive with the incorrect amount, you must step aside and contact us at our office (623-335-1555) so we can send you an invoice. Please plan ahead and let us know how you want to pay. You can't wait until 7:45 or later and then ask for an invoice, or you will be late for class. YOU CANNOT BE LATE.

## Virtual Class Process & Information

* You must get a once-in-a-lifetime waiver from the Arizona Chapter National Safety Council (602) 222-3381.
* After you have been notified that you were granted the waiver, please call or text us, and we will register you for a class.
* Our Virtual/Online class costs $129, which includes the workbook but not the shipping and handling ($10)
* **A workbook is required for this class!** It is unfortunately not available in a digital format. If you cannot pick up the workbook in person (and pay the $129 in cash or money order), we will send it to you via FedEx. We need your physical address because FedEx will not deliver to a PO box. Please include any extra numbers, such as apartment, building, space, etc.
* You pay $10 for shipping and handling unless there are special needs, like overnight delivery (which will likely cost more). The total will generally be $139. We work hard to keep the cost low for you.

**FOR ALL CLASSES: please check in online by 7:30 am Phoenix, Arizona, MST!**

* To check in, you will need your photo ID and the workbook.
* This class will be conducted on a <a href="https://www.zoom.com/">Zoom</a> call. You will need a computer or tablet (preferably not a cell phone), stable internet access, a camera, and a microphone. This is a live Zoom class with a live instructor and live classmates.
* While attending this class, you will not be able to work or do other activities simultaneously, such as childcare or video games. The instructor and your classmates must be able to see and hear you during the entire instructional time.
* All participants will need a computer or tablet with a webcam and microphone. The device must have a power source to remain operative for the 8-hour class and be connected to a steady Wi-Fi signal. If you're using your phone signal and the signal drops, you will drop out of the class.
* Zoom is the only platform that will allow virtual classes. You must download the most current version of Zoom onto your computer or device. If you are still getting familiar with the device you are using or Zoom itself, please practice! Check your settings. Be ready.
* Here are two videos on how to use zoom: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh50kVaIdAY">How to use Zoom (video 1)</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02UmBR4UK58">How to use Zoom (video 2)</a>
* Proper dress attire will be required. You must wear appropriate clothing free of offensive or disturbing content. The background must be neutral. This is subject to instructor discretion. Your instructor must see your face and hear you speak during instructional time. You will need a quiet area free of distractions, minimal background noise, and the Participant Guide (the workbook). This live Zoom class will be monitored and possibly recorded by the National Safety Council / MVD.
